        <h3>General Facts</h3>
        <p>
          <strong>
            Cigarette smoking is the leading cause of preventable disease and
            death in the United States, accounting for more than 480,000 deaths
            every year, or about 1 in 5 deaths.1 In 2018, nearly 14 of every 100
            U.S. adults aged 18 years or older (13.7%) currently* smoked
            cigarettes. This means an estimated 34.2 million adults in the
            United States currently smoke cigarettes.2 More than 16 million
            Americans live with a smoking-related disease.
          </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          Current smoking has declined from 20.9% (nearly 21 of every 100
          adults) in 2005 to 13.7% (nearly 14 of every 100 adults) in 2018, and
          the proportion of ever smokers who have quit has increased.
